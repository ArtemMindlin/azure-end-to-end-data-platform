# Azure End-to-End Data Platform

End-to-end data platform built on Microsoft Azure covering ingestion, processing, storage, and visualization. The project demonstrates how to design and deploy a scalable, secure, and reproducible cloud-based analytics solution using managed Azure services and Infrastructure as Code.

## Architecture Overview
The platform follows a layered architecture:
- **Ingestion:** Automated data ingestion from external sources
- **Storage:** Raw and curated data stored in Azure-managed services
- **Processing:** Cloud-based data transformations
- **Analytics & Visualization:** Business-ready datasets exposed through Power BI
- **Infrastructure:** Fully reproducible deployment using Infrastructure as Code

## Technologies Used
- Azure Data Factory
- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure SQL Database / Azure Synapse Analytics
- Azure Databricks / Azure Functions
- Power BI
- Infrastructure as Code (Bicep / Terraform)
- Python, SQL

## Key Features
- End-to-end data lifecycle management
- Automated and scheduled pipelines
- Secure secret management and access control
- Cost-aware and scalable cloud design
- Reproducible infrastructure deployments
